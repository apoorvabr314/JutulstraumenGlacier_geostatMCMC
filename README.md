# Geostatistical MCMC Reconstruction of Jutulstraumen Subglacial Bed Topography
This repository contains my final project for GLY4930 — Geophysical Exploration of the Cryosphere, where I apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) geostatistical framework to reconstruct high-resolution bed topography beneath the Jutulstraumen Glacier, East Antarctica.

The workflow adapts the methodology described in Shao et al. (in review), along with the companion codebase:

This README summarizes the glacier background, scientific motivation, method, workflow, and reproduction instructions.

## Background: Jutulstraumen Glacier

Jutulstraumen is a major fast-flowing outlet glacier draining into the Fimbul Ice Shelf. It has the following features:

- A central trunk exceeding 400–500 m/yr

- Strong shear margins

- Deep, narrow subglacial troughs

- Sparse radar coverage along large portions of the flowline

Because the glacier funnels ice through a constrained basin, its modeled flow behavior and grounding-line stability depend sensitively on bed geometry. Accurate bed reconstruction is thus essential for realistic ice-flow modeling and understanding regional dynamics.
